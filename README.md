ðŸš—CAR RENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IN C++ USING FILE HANDLING ðŸ“‚

Language: C++ | Platform: Console-Based | Data Storage: File Handling 

This Car Rental Management System is a console-based application developed in C++, focused on managing car rental operations using file handling techniques. It simulates a basic car rental service where administrators can manage cars and users can register, search, and rent cars â€” all while storing data in files instead of a database.
ðŸ”§ Features:
ðŸ”¹ Admin Panel:
Add new cars with details (model, number, availability)
View, update, and manage car inventory
Display all available and rented cars

ðŸ”¹ User Functions:
User registration and login (credentials stored securely in files)
Search for available cars
Rent a car (updates car status in file)
View personal details and rental history

ðŸ“‚ File Handling Includes:
Car data stored and retrieved from text/binary files
User credentials and rental history maintained through structured file I/O
Ensures persistent storage across sessions

ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes:
Strong command of object-oriented programming (OOP) in C++
Mastery of file handling for data persistence
Development of menu-driven UI and basic system logic
Practical simulation of real-world rental management using pure C++
